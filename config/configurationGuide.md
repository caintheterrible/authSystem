#### Achieved 
for now, all configurations are fetched directly from `base.py` by Django.
The design system for this project is to reflect an understanding of modular design
and efficient codebase management. Thus, as I progress further in the process I will be breaking the
configuration files into manageable spaces to account for potential scaling capabilities without necessarily
bloating the codebase. I successfully configured and deployed Django in minimal
terms.

#### Next goal:
* configure logging functionality
* configure environment-specific deployment strategy
* modularize configuration files

#### Deadline: May 26, 2025.
