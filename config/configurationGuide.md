#### Achieved 
for now, all configurations are fetched directly from `base.py` by Django.
The design system for this project is to reflect an understanding of modular design
and efficient codebase management. Thus, as I progress further in the process I will be breaking the
configuration files into manageable spaces to account for potential scaling capabilities without necessarily
bloating the codebase. I successfully configured and deployed Django in minimal
terms.

#### Next goal:
* configure logging functionality
* configure environment-specific deployment strategy
* modularize configuration files

#### Achieved
learning to build introspective configuration systems in Django. I've been lazying a little, so I am somewhat a day late.
I don't fully understand everything but hopefully over time I should be able to configure them myself without AI.
Just finished a centralized configuration system for database configuration and management.
i now have to integrate this system into my previous configuration.
